.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Xo Ar begin
.Xc
Marks the start of your workday. If you are not in a state to start the work day (ie: never ended your last shift, never resumed from a pause), you will be asked to rectify this situation through stdin. You can choose to delete the previous day's work, or estimate a stopping point. 
.It Xo Ar pause
.Xc
Pauses your shift. Time after this pause, until the next resume, will not be counted (for your daily total, it is tracked for use in the stat subcommand). If you are not in a state to pause the work day (ie: are currently paused, have not started), you will be asked to rectify this situation through stdin.

.Sh LOG FILES
Log files are where 
.Nm workday
stores its human readable data. By default, logs are written to ~/.workday.txt
however, by passing 
.Op --logfile Ar file
you can specify the location from which 
.Nm workday
reads and writes. You generally shouldn't have to modify the logfile manually, 
but if you do, make sure you maintain the following format. Each line is exactly
LOGFILE_BYTES_PER_LINE bytes long (27 is the current value).
.Sh EXIT CODES
If you need to know more about an error, cross reference the program's exit code ($? in bash) against the following list.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
enum exit_codes {
    SUCCESS                   = 0,
    FILE_READ_FAILURE         = 1,
    FILE_WRITE_FAILURE        = 2,
    NO_MEMORY_ERROR           = 3,

    ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT          = 5,
    TIME_RETRIEVE_ERROR       = 6,
